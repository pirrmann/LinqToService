# Linq to Service 
An implementation of a Linq to Service provider, documented in a series of blog posts available at http://www.pirrmann.net/tag/linq-provider/

## What can it be used for?
Not much for now. Learn how things work, mostly. And then come back to me and teach me how to make it better !
